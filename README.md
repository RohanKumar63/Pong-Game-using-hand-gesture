# Pong Game Using Hand Gestures

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using hand gestures for player control.

## Overview

The Pong game allows one or two players to control paddles using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and score points by preventing the ball from reaching your side of the screen.

## Features

- Single-player and two-player modes.
- Hand gesture recognition for paddle control.
- Score tracking.
- Game over detection.
- Restart option.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone (for hand tracking)
- numpy

  ```

## Usage

1. Run the game:

   ```
   python pong_game.py
   ```

2. Choose between single-player and two-player modes by pressing the corresponding key ('1' for single-player, '2' for two-player).

3. Control the paddle(s) using hand gestures:
   - For single-player mode: Use your left hand to control the paddle.
   - For two-player mode: Use your left hand for Player 1 and your right hand for Player 2.

4. Hit the ball with your paddle to prevent it from reaching your side of the screen and score points.

5. The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined score limit (e.g., 5 points).

6. Press 'r' to restart the game after it ends.
